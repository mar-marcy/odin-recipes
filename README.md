This repo is a showcase of a lesson I am doing through The Odin Project in regards
to making useful and frequent commit messages on GitHub.

I'll be building a website structure and populating it, in hopes that I use the skills that I've
learned to create a good timeline of commits.

I hope that this lesson helps me with intuition while using Git, as well as teaches me how I can
solve problems while using it in the future.
